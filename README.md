## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Git hub wants this to be installed for some reason...... well you asked the questions so here are the answers.

**RobOrtonWindstil/RobOrtonWindstil** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... private information, i am not authorised to talk about it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... everything I can, as always
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... the people I work with at the company I work for
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... everything, but I understand that is a bit broad.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything you like, expect to be disappointed.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... you cannot.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... ffs who cares?  with everything going on in the world today this is the least important thing to me and honestly it is none of your business; just as yours are none of mine.  PLEASE don't try to tell me.  I JUST DON'T CARE!!!!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... life is a game, you should learn how to love playing it because you can't ever get another free credit.
